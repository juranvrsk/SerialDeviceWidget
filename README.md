# SerialDeviceWidget
An application for monitoring connected serial devices. I made it for comfortable work with the several serial devices (like MCU, USB-TTL, etc.) simultaneously.
There are three ways to look a serial port list in this application:
1. The widget-like window, where possible to order the ports by its number, hide the useless ports and set up refresh period for the usb poll
2. The notify icon menu, clickable(left mouse button)
3. The toast notifications for the newly inserted devices.
Works on windows 10.
